        <p>
            Buckets is a private, personal and family budgeting app.
            All your data stays on your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Buckets comes with an untimed, free trial for as
            long as you need to decide if it works for you. When
            you decide to purchase, a one-time payment buys
            a license for the current major version. The license
            may be used on any number of devices belonging to your
            immediate family members living in your home.
